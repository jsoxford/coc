      <h1>JSOxford Code of Conduct</h1>

      <h2>The quick version</h2>

      <p>The JSOxford Group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, religious beliefs, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from from JSOxford services or events at the discretion of the JSOxford organisers.</p>

      <h2>The less quick version</h2>

      <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, religious beliefs, technology choices, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any JSOxford event or communication channel. Harassment in online services extends to sending excessively large or numerous messages, or uploading offensive images or videos.</p>

      <p>Everyone using JSOxford services or attending JSOxford events is subject to the anti-harassment policy; this includes sponsors, speakers, recruiters and organisers.</p>
      Anyone asked to stop any harassing behavior is expected to comply immediately.

      <p>If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the JSOxford organisers may warn the offender or expel them from JSOxford services or events. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns; please contact a JSOxford organiser immediately.</p>

      <p>JSOxford organisers may also provide an additional code of conduct for the needs of individual communication channels or events.</p>
